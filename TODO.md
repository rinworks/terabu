- Create skeleton Python project with unit tests - use Pytest for this project
- Create skeleton API for generating summary files.
- Write skeleton test code that calls above API.
- Write test code that generates and cleans up a root test directory worth of
  test files - parameterized somehow to deal with different directory structures
  and file sizes.
- Iterative development and testing of the summary generation functionality.
  Include using MongoDB to suck the summary into collections (this process
  will provide feedback on the format and usage models.)
- Properly document summary file format and API.
